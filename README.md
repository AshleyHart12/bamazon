# Bamazon App 

Welcome to Bamazon! This application will allow customer to shop at your online store.

After connecting to the databse, the customer will be shown a list of the products available:

Your customer will be asked to choose the ID of the product they want to buy from the list, and how many units they want to purchase:

Once a selection is made, the app will print out the customer's 'receipt' with the product name, quantity, unit price, and the total charge:
